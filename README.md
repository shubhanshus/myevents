# myevents

This repository contains code for a cloud native web application. I have built a event app which allows user to book,create and modify events. This app was built to learn various aspects of microservices architecture.

The backend is divided into two different services one for bookingservice and another for events. Both are seprate services and deployed on different containers.

Technologies Used: Go, mongodb, React, Docker, RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka

TODO's:

- Add kubernetes for managing containers
- Add functionality for logging
- Add support for migration into cloud
